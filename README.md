These are all my Visual Studio projects.
Most of them are finished and 'working', however:
- for the ones with 'c_winapi' in the title, you must link the file up with: Drawing.h, Drawing.c, Util.h, and Util.c. You can find these in ArchimedesP/CTools.
- the 'c_winapi' projects might be a bit outdated, since the updated 'Drawing.h' functions have an 'opacity' parameter that the older files don't account for; which u can fix by adding a 0 to the last parameter

Enjoy!
